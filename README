Bookmarkit! - save and edit your bookmarks online.

Developed by Jesse Clark.

This was a learning exercise using the Zend Framework. I had no previous ZF experience before working on this project.


Currently you can add, delete, edit bookmarks, and create folders.

Todo: - Rearrange bookmarks
	  - Add bookmarks from file (from any browsers export bookmarks file)
